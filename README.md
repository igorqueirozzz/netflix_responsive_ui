# Netflix Clone

This is a Netflix-inspired interface project developed to practice and enhance my Flutter skills.

## Description

The project involves replicating the Netflix app interface using Flutter to build responsive screens for web and mobile devices. Flutter widgets and resources were utilized to create a visually similar interface to the original app. This project is purely educational and not affiliated with the Netflix company.

## Motivation

Creating this Netflix interface clone aims to provide hands-on experience and improve mobile app development skills using Flutter. The project serves as an exercise to explore layout structure, component organization and user interface interaction.

## Disclaimer

This project is a recreation of the Netflix interface and is for educational and training purposes only. I have no affiliation or association with Netflix. The use of this project and its source code is entirely at the user's own risk. I am not responsible for any misuse, copyright infringement, or other consequences resulting from the use of this project.
